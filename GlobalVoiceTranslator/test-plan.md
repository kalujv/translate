## Testing Results Summary

All tests completed. The application now uses the Web Speech API for direct browser speech recognition, eliminating the previous audio data transmission issues. Translations are performed via the OpenAI API, and results are displayed in real-time.

Key improvements:
- Speech recognition happens locally in the browser
- Text is displayed as the user speaks
- Translations are processed after natural speech pauses
- Text-to-speech provides immediate audio feedback

The application is now functioning correctly across all tested scenarios and is ready for delivery.
